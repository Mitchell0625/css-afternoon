# css-afternoon
clone of DesignBetter.Co website


I am creating this project to sharpen my CSS skills. At the time of my first commit, the project is not responsive. In the future, I hope to:

    -Add CSS animation
    -Make the page  responsive based on DesignBetter.Co's breakpoints
    -Add an icon to the tab
    -Add the remaining sections of their homepage
